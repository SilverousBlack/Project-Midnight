# ENTHEREON CIPHER PROJECTS

> Copyright &copy; 2013 - 2021 Silverous Black

The **Enthereon Cipher Projects** are a series of projects and studies into cryptology and cryption technology. The series started as early as Fall 2013, primarily being study into numeric encryption and decryption. As to date, after Project Sunset in Spring 2017, the series now focuses on a full symbolic cryption.

## Project Fake Numerals (Fall 2013 - Fall 2016)

The very first Enthereon Cipher Project, and primarily mathematically driven encryption. Moreover, the project only supported visual characters from the 9x9 keyboard with trans-numerical trans-literation. The cipher set is a simple alphabet character definition, with static non-user-bound encryption. The project evolved in terms of mathemical deriviation over the years of activity, generally, manually derived for each visual character using a defined formula for the generation. The project ended with a system of crypted character manual deriviation, generally being an extremely weak and common encryption.

## Project Sunset (Spring 2017)

Features full support to all visual character symbols in the ASCII table and partial support to the extensions in Unicode, superceding Project Fake Numerals in visual character support. Also uses predefined cryption set, with all values from a string taken as a character, allowing an literal trans-cryption for every possible visual character in the ASCII table. The cryption method requires a character-look up from the defined cryption set, as the project moved away from mathematical value deriviation. Towards its end, the project finished with a manual system of cryption and a barely stable software capable of the encryption method. The project resulted in the realization of a symbolic cryption engine, capable of retrieving a certain character from a defined cryption set.

## Project Midnight (Winter 2020)

With a fully stable symbolic cryption engine still in development, Project Midnight succeeds Project Sunset by implementing the theoretical engine in terms of a database, with data retrieval and storage of a cryption set problems being solved in this manner. The system of encryption features a full symbolic support for the entire Unicode character set, consisting of 1,112,064 characters, including a support for control characters. Moreover, the project features a non-static and user-dependent and user-trans-defined cryption set, due to the sheer power brought by the databasing method of implemetation of the still-theoretical symbolic cryption engine. However, with this development, the encryption method is no longer viable to be done manually (though possible), due to efficiency problems in manual calculations. The project, lastly, features a graphical user interface, in a fully stable software that processes the cryption method.

## Project Eclipse (Summer 2021, *est.*)

The crowning piece of the series, promises a full symbolic cryption down to the binary level of a symbol. This project promises an encryption technology that is logically unbreakable, taking inspiration from the infamous *Enigma Code*, with near infinite finite crypt possibilities. This would use the symbolic engine that has been in development for the past 4 years, thereby superceding Project Midnight, with all dependencies and requiries with the system itself, fully handled by the engine. The project will end with a native software that is capable of the cryption processes within itself, improving portability and system security. The cryption system is largely user-dependent, where the cryption set is dynamically generated per user per instance per machine installation, and takes a file and character (live) inputs.
